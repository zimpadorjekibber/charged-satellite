const admin = require('firebase-admin');

// Initialize Firebase Admin (Using Application Default Credentials or Service Account)
// Assuming you have set GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS in your environment or are running in an environment that provides them (like Cloud Shell or local emulator)
// If not, you'd need a service account key file. For this simplified script, we'll try default init.
// IF RUNNING LOCALLY WITHOUT ENV VARS, THIS MIGHT FAIL.
//
// SAFEGUARD: We will assume we can use the 'test' or simulated environment if this is for a specific user request where auth is tricky.
// HOWEVER, safely deleting Firestore data usually requires Admin SDK.

// Since I cannot easily authenticate as Admin without a key file in this environment,
// I will create a CLIENT-SIDE script that the user can run via their browser console or a temporary admin page button?
// No, user asked ME to delete them. I have 'run_command' access but no SERVICE ACCOUNT KEY.

// ALTERNATIVE: Use the existing client-side code in a temporary node script that signs in anonymously? 
// No, client SDK in node needs specific handling.

// BETTER APPROACH: Create a temporary cleanup utility in the source code (e.g., a hidden admin button or API route) 
// and then trigger it. 
// OR simpler: Just create a specialized cleanup script using the Client SDK which I CAN run if I hardcode the config (which I know from firebase.ts).

const { initializeApp } = require('firebase/app');
const { getFirestore, collection, getDocs, deleteDoc, doc } = require('firebase/firestore');

// Load config from regex search or previous knowledge.
// I will read firebase.ts to get the config first to ensure accuracy.
